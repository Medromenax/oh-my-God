```
bash ./install.sh
```

After that, change the following line in your .zshrc file to:

ZSH_THEME="oh-my-God"

# Recommendations:
If you want your terminal to look like mine, i recommend you to install 2 plugins: [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [zsh-auto-suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions). i also recommend the use of a dark theme for your terminal, like Dark GNOME for the gnome terminal.
